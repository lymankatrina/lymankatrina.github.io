            <h3>Fitts's Law</h3>
            <h4>National Geographic</h4>

            <p>Fitts's law predicts that the ability to quickly reach a target is linked to the size and accessibility of the target.
                The National Geographic website employs fitts's law to make it easy for visitors to its site to subscribe to their magazine.
                The subscribe button is easy to see, placed prominently at the top of the page. It is larger than the other navigation bar options,
                and it is bold, solid black with white font in all caps so it really stands out.

            <h3>P.A.R.C.</h3>
            <h4>Tiffany & Co.</h4>
            <h4><a href="https://www.tiffany.com/">tiffany.com</a></h4>
            <img src="images/Screenshot (Jan 16, 2021 8_05_59 PM).png" alt="screenshot of tiffany company website">
            <p>P.A.R.C. (Proximity, Alignment, Repetition, and Contrast) are all used successfully by Tiffany & Co. in their website.
                First off, the famous Tiffany Blue is seen in the header of the page, and is repeated in the shadows of the jewelry items.
                The relationship between each jewelry item is clear and defined by category. The images are aligned and spaced carefully with reference
                to each other and the page. There is a nice contrast between the fonts, the images, and the white space, padding and borders.

            <h3>White Space & Clean Design</h3>
            <h4>Fiber Art Now</h4>
            <h4><a href="https://fiberartnow.net/">fiberartnow.net</a></h4>
            <img src="images/Screenshot (Jan 16, 2021 8_15_47 PM).png" alt="screenshot of fiber art now website">
            <p>When you visit an art gallery, the art is typically displayed in a relatively empty room, so that you can more fully appreciate the artwork you came to see.
                The Fiber Art Network website dose a great job of eliminating distractions and seperating page elements by blank space. The website is clean and organized.
