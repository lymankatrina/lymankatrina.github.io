            <h2>Site Name: Bear River Range Weather & Events</h2>
            <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the Bear River Range Weather & Events site is to provide 
                the Idaho communities of Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven with current local weather 
                and event information for their area. These communities surround the Bear River Mountain 
                Range along the Bear River and Bear Lake in Southeastern Idah. The population of these communities
                is small. The local news does not provide weather and event information for this area regularly. 
                This site will be visited by locals who want to know current weather statistics for their 
                communities. The Bear River Mountain Range that lies in the center of these communities is a 
                popular place for outdoor enthusiasts. This site will be a place for local residents to direct
                visitors with information on the area. Local businesses can link to this website so their clients
                can find information on the area. People who enjoy visiting this area for recreation purposes will
                be able to find articles, photos, and up to date information on the area.</p>
